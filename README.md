Prime Number Cooling Emulator
This project is an emulator that simulates a cooling system using prime numbers as an analogy. The concept is inspired by the unique properties of prime numbers and their applications in various fields.

## Features
The emulator utilizes prime numbers to model the behavior of a cooling system. Prime numbers are used in specific intervals to represent different stages of the cooling process. The emulator calculates temperatures based on the intervals between prime numbers, where each prime number represents a specific temperature level in the system. The emulator also includes a simulation of an expansion valve. After passing through the compressor, the temperature experiences an exponential expansion, simulating the cooling effect. Additionally, a heat dissipation logic has been implemented that progressively reduces the system temperature after the exponential expansion.

## Usage
To run the emulator, make sure you have Python installed. Then, execute the `refrigeration_emulator.py` script:

```bash
python refrigeration_emulator.py

The emulator will output the simulated temperatures at different stages of the cooling process.
