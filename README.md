Prime Number Cooling Emulator
This project is an emulator that simulates a cooling system using prime numbers as an analogy. The concept is inspired by the unique properties of prime numbers and their applications in various fields.

Features
Prime Number Logic: The emulator utilizes prime numbers to model the behavior of a cooling system. Prime numbers are used in specific intervals to represent different stages of the cooling process.

Temperature Calculation: The emulator calculates temperatures based on the intervals between prime numbers. Each prime number represents a specific temperature level in the system.

Expansion Valve Simulation: The emulator includes a simulation of an expansion valve. After passing through the compressor, the temperature experiences an exponential expansion, simulating the cooling effect.

Usage
To run the emulator, make sure you have Python installed. Then, execute the refrigeration_emulator.py script.

bash
Copy code
python refrigeration_emulator.py
The emulator will output the simulated temperatures at different stages of the cooling process.
